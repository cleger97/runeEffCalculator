things to do:
1) don't let -eff happen, cap at zero 
   - potential gain = (potential gain) if > 0 else 0
2) max eff (all grinds) and max eff (current grind selected)
   - have a # for maxeffall or maxeffgrind
3) sort results of a search
   - put all results in an array
   - have options after a search instead of just going to immediate next
   - resort option, will resort on the results array
4) option to lock potential gain to a minimum value (for max/min grinds)
   - when searching have an option for minimum potential gain
   - default to none
